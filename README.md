Tired of favorite packages not being available and limited storage.
If you’re using goinfre, you’ll need to stick to the same computer.
super annoying, I know.
**this script installs those packages with one click.**

# Confing
- Add this to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/goinfre/goinfre-py/bin"
```
